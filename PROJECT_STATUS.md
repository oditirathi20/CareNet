## 🎤 Your Pitch (30 seconds)

*"Healthcare fraud costs $68 billion annually. We built a blockchain platform that uses AI to validate treatment plans before claims are paid. Smart contracts enforce role-based access - patients see their data, doctors manage treatments, and Loop advisors use GPT-4 to instantly flag suspicious cases. We're making healthcare transparent, reducing fraud, and protecting patients."*

## 🎯 Core Features Implemented

### Smart Contract:
✅ Three role types (Patient, Doctor, LoopAdvisor)  
✅ Patient data registration and storage  
✅ Treatment plan creation and management  
✅ Doctor-patient assignment  
✅ Granular access control with modifiers  
✅ Event emission for transparency  

### AI Backend:
✅ OpenAI GPT-4 integration  
✅ Medical domain expert prompting  
✅ Treatment validity analysis  
✅ Red flag detection  
✅ Transparency recommendations  

### Frontend:
✅ MetaMask wallet connection  
✅ Automatic role detection  
✅ Patient registration interface  
✅ Doctor treatment management  
✅ Advisor oversight and AI analysis  
✅ Professional UI with animations
